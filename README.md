⚙️ Key Features
Command-Line Interface (CLI) or GUI Interface

Users can interact using simple commands (like open, create, exit, etc.) or through buttons in a GUI window.

File Operations

Create, read, and delete dummy files using simulated commands.

Process Management

Mimics process creation and execution using Java threads.

Task Dashboard

Displays active processes or actions in a text area (if GUI-based).

System Logs

Shows user activity, such as commands executed or actions taken.

🧠 Concepts Used
Java Core Concepts: Classes, objects, inheritance, exception handling.

Multithreading: Simulates parallel process execution.

Swing GUI: For creating windows, buttons, and output areas.

File I/O: To simulate file-related commands.

Event Handling: Responds to button clicks or text input.

🏗️ Technology Stack
Component	Technology Used
Language	Java

🧩 Working
When you run the program using:

bash
Copy code
java MiniOS
a GUI window (or command shell) appears.

User can type commands like:

lua
Copy code
create file1
run task1
exit
or click GUI buttons.

The system logs responses and shows simulated output for each task.

Program continues until the user exits.

🎯 Learning Outcomes
Understand how an operating system interacts with user commands.

Learn Java GUI programming and thread handling.

Gain knowledge of event-driven programming in Java.

Practice compiling and executing Java applications via command line.
